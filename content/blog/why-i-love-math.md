Math isn't just about numbers and formulas. It's about patterns, puzzles, and the satisfaction of solving something that seemed impossible.

## How It Started

I got into competitive math when I was 12. At first, I hated it. The problems were hard, I didn't understand anything, and everyone else seemed way smarter than me.

But then something clicked.

## The Moment It Changed

I remember working on a geometry problem for three days straight. I tried everything - coordinate geometry, similar triangles, angle chasing. Nothing worked.

Then, at 2 AM on a school night, I saw it. A single auxiliary line that made everything fall into place. The proof was elegant. Beautiful, even.

That's when I realized: **math isn't about being smart. It's about being stubborn.**

## What I've Learned

After years of olympiads and competitions, here's what I know:

1. **Everyone struggles.** Even the gold medalists. The difference is they keep going.
2. **There's always a trick.** If your solution is ugly, there's probably a cleaner way.
3. **Teaching helps you learn.** I understood concepts 10x better after explaining them to others.

## Why It Matters

Math taught me how to think. How to break down complex problems. How to stay calm when stuck. How to find beauty in logic.

These skills apply everywhere - coding, life decisions, even just debugging why my code doesn't work at 3 AM.

If you're struggling with math, don't give up. The frustration is part of the process. And when that moment of clarity hits, it's worth every second of confusion.
