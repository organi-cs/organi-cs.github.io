# Hey, you're here? Here's more about me! ദ്ദി (◝ ⩊ ◜).ᐟ

Hi hi! I'm **Samputhy**, a student from **Cambodia** 🇰🇭. I'm super into math, CS, and building tools that actually help people.

I love **competition math**, **cybersecurity**, and lately I've been obsessing over how to make Cambodian public data easier to access. When I'm not studying or staring at terminal windows, I'm usually tutoring math, training ML models, or designing posters for student orgs. ૮ ˶ᵔ ᵕ ᵔ˶ ა

###  About This Site

I wanted something unique, so I built this site with a **Retro Roblox** aesthetic — think early 2000s game UI with beveled borders and pixel fonts.

* **Style:** Retro OS / Early Roblox 
* **Vibe:** Chunky panels, custom XP cursors, studs background
* **Tech:** Next.js, React, Static Export
