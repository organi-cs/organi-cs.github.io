# Hey, you're here? Here's more about me! ദ്ദി (◝ ⩊ ◜).ᐟ

Hi hi! I'm **Samputhy**, a student from **Cambodia** 🇰🇭. I'm super into math, CS, and building tools that actually help people.

I love **competition math**, **cybersecurity**, and lately I've been obsessing over how to make Cambodian public data easier to access. When I'm not studying or staring at terminal windows, I'm usually tutoring math, training ML models, or designing posters for student orgs. ૮ ˶ᵔ ᵕ ᵔ˶ ა

###  What I'm Currently Working on!

* **CamData:** A dashboard for Cambodian gov data (exchange rates, air quality) 
* **PhishBlasters:** Cybersecurity education for ASEAN students 
* **Math Books:** Two volumes of olympiad problems distributed across Cambodia 
* **Learning:** Data viz, ML, and how to not break production
